# Hunger Bounce

Hunger Bounce is an idea to bring food sharing revolution between organisations, communities and households.

Our platform helps to connect local retailers, schools, home/neighbours etc so that the surplus perfectly edible good food can be shared and not disposed of. These surplus food can be shared for some discounted price or even as charities, by supporting local communities through various organisations.
